# Project Images

## Current Images
- `rag.jpg` - Currently used for all projects as placeholder

## How to Add Project Images

1. Add your project images to this directory
2. Recommended specs:
   - Size: 600x400px (3:2 aspect ratio)
   - Format: JPG, PNG, or WebP
   - File size: Under 200KB for optimal loading

3. Update the image paths in `src/data/projects.json`:

```json
{
  "imageUrl": "/assets/projects/your-image-name.jpg"
}
```

## Suggested Image Names

Based on your current projects:
- `llm.jpg` - For "LLM from Scratch" project
- `rag.jpg` - For "RAG for LLM" project (already exists)
- `trading.jpg` - For "ML Trading System" project
- `sentiment.jpg` - For "Sentiment Analysis API" project
- `image-class.jpg` - For "Custom Image Classifier" project

## Current Status
All projects currently use `rag.jpg` as a temporary placeholder. Add individual project images and update the JSON file to display unique images for each project.
