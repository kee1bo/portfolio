## 🖼️ Image Issue Fixed

**Problem**: Images not showing in project cards

**Solution**: 
1. Created `public/assets/projects/` folder
2. Added README explaining where to put images
3. Images must be placed in `public/assets/projects/`

**To add your images:**
```bash
# Copy your images to:
portfolio-website/public/assets/projects/llm.jpg
portfolio-website/public/assets/projects/rag.jpg
portfolio-website/public/assets/projects/trading.jpg
```

The paths in `projects.json` are correct:
```json
"imageUrl": "/assets/projects/rag.jpg"
```

This will look for the file at `public/assets/projects/rag.jpg`.

## 📝 Content Structure

### profile.json
```json
{
  "bio": "...",
  "currentRole": "...",
  "affiliation": "...",
  "education": [...],
  "currentFocus": [...],
  "skills": [...]
}
```

All displayed in the About section!
