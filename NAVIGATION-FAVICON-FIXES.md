# Navigation & Favicon Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. âœ… Navigation Highlighting Issue
**Problem**: "About" was being highlighted when scrolling at the top of the homepage

**Root Cause**: The scroll detection logic was checking sections from top to bottom, and "About" was the first section after "Home", so it would activate too early.

**Solution**: 
- Added check for very top of page (scrollY < 50) to always show "Home" as active
- Changed section checking to reverse order (bottom to top)
- This ensures the correct section is highlighted based on scroll position
- Added `handleScroll()` call on mount to set initial state correctly

**Files Modified**:
- `src/components/common/Navigation/Navigation.jsx`

**Result**: Now "Home" stays active when at the top, and sections highlight correctly as you scroll down.

### 2. âœ… Favicon Updated to Triangular Logo
**Problem**: Vite logo was showing in browser tab

**Solution**: 
- Updated `index.html` to use your `triangular-logo.png`
- Removed references to non-existent favicon files
- Simplified to use single PNG file for all favicon needs

**Files Modified**:
- `index.html`

**Favicon Links Now**:
```html
<link rel="icon" type="image/png" href="/triangular-logo.png" />
<link rel="apple-touch-icon" href="/triangular-logo.png" />
<link rel="shortcut icon" type="image/png" href="/triangular-logo.png" />
```

**Result**: Your black triangular logo now appears in:
- Browser tabs
- Bookmarks
- iOS home screen (when saved)
- Browser history

## Testing

### Navigation Fix
1. Go to homepage
2. Scroll to top - "Home" should be highlighted
3. Scroll down slowly - sections should highlight in order:
   - Home â†’ About â†’ Projects â†’ Blog â†’ Contact
4. Scroll back up - highlighting should update correctly
5. No section should be highlighted incorrectly

### Favicon
1. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete or Cmd+Shift+Delete)
2. Reload page (Ctrl+R or Cmd+R)
3. Check browser tab - should show triangular logo
4. Bookmark the page - should show triangular logo
5. Check on mobile - should show triangular logo

**Note**: Favicon changes may take a few minutes to appear due to browser caching. If it doesn't show immediately:
- Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
- Clear browser cache completely
- Close and reopen browser

## Technical Details

### Navigation Logic
```javascript
// If at very top, always show Home
if (window.scrollY < 50) {
  setActiveSection('home');
  return;
}

// Check sections in reverse order (bottom to top)
// This ensures the correct section is active based on scroll position
const reversedSections = [...sections].reverse();

for (const section of reversedSections) {
  if (section.id === 'home') continue;
  
  const element = document.getElementById(section.id);
  if (element) {
    const { offsetTop } = element;
    if (scrollPosition >= offsetTop) {
      setActiveSection(section.id);
      return;
    }
  }
}
```

### Why Reverse Order?
When checking from bottom to top, we find the first section whose top is above the current scroll position. This is more accurate than checking top to bottom, which can activate sections too early.

## Files Changed

1. `src/components/common/Navigation/Navigation.jsx`
   - Fixed scroll detection logic
   - Added top-of-page check
   - Reversed section checking order

2. `index.html`
   - Updated favicon links to use triangular-logo.png
   - Removed references to non-existent favicon files

## Additional Notes

### Favicon Optimization (Optional)
Your current `triangular-logo.png` works perfectly. If you want to optimize further:

1. **Create multiple sizes** (optional):
   - 16x16px for browser tabs
   - 32x32px for bookmarks
   - 180x180px for iOS
   - 512x512px for Android

2. **Convert to ICO** (optional):
   - Use https://convertio.co/png-ico/
   - Create favicon.ico for older browsers

But the current single PNG works great for modern browsers!
