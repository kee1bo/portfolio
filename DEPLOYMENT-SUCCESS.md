## 🚀 Next Step: Deploy to Netlify

### Option 1: Netlify Dashboard (Recommended - 5 minutes)

1. **Go to Netlify**
   - Visit: https://app.netlify.com
   - Sign in with your GitHub account (kee1bo)

2. **Import Project**
   - Click "Add new site" → "Import an existing project"
   - Choose "Deploy with GitHub"
   - Authorize Netlify if needed

3. **Select Repository**
   - Find and click on: **kee1bo/portfolio**

4. **Configure Build Settings**
   - Netlify will auto-detect from `netlify.toml`
   - Verify these settings:
     - **Branch**: `main`
     - **Build command**: `npm run build`
     - **Publish directory**: `dist`
   - Click "Deploy site"

5. **Wait for Build** (2-3 minutes)
   - Watch the deploy log
   - First build takes a bit longer

6. **Your Site is Live!** 🎉
   - You'll get a URL like: `https://random-name-123.netlify.app`
   - You can change this name in settings

---

### Option 2: Netlify CLI (Alternative)

```bash
# Install Netlify CLI (if not installed)
npm install -g netlify-cli

# Login to Netlify
netlify login

# Deploy
netlify deploy --prod
```

---

## 🌐 Configure Custom Domain (saivikas.work)

After your site is deployed:

1. **In Netlify Dashboard**
   - Go to: Site settings → Domain management
   - Click "Add custom domain"
   - Enter: `saivikas.work`
   - Click "Verify"

2. **Update DNS at Your Domain Registrar**
   
   Add these DNS records:
   
   **A Record**:
   ```
   Type: A
   Name: @ (or leave blank)
   Value: 75.2.60.5
   TTL: 3600
   ```
   
   **CNAME Record**:
   ```
   Type: CNAME
   Name: www
   Value: your-site-name.netlify.app
   TTL: 3600
   ```

3. **Wait for DNS Propagation**
   - Usually takes 1-2 hours
   - Can take up to 48 hours
   - Check status: https://dnschecker.org

4. **HTTPS Certificate**
   - Netlify automatically provisions SSL
   - Takes a few minutes after DNS is configured
   - Your site will be accessible via https://saivikas.work

## 🔄 How to Update Your Site

Making updates is super easy now:

```bash
# 1. Make your changes (edit files)

# 2. Stage changes
git add .

# 3. Commit with a message
git commit -m "Update: description of changes"

# 4. Push to GitHub
git push origin main
```

**That's it!** Netlify automatically:
- Detects the push
- Runs `npm run build`
- Deploys the new version
- Takes 2-3 minutes
